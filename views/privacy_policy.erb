    <h2>Social Teeth Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We respect your right to privacy.</p>
    <p>As stated in the Terms of Use, when you contribute to an ad, we give your user name, email address, and contribution amount to the owner of the ad.
    They will only use that information to provide information about their fundraising campaign on Social Teeth's platform. They will never give or sell your 
    name or personal information to other third parties, and neither will Social Teeth.</p>
    <p>Stripe processes all of the transactions on Social Teeth. Therefore, your personal information is required to process your transactions. 
    However, no one sees your credit card information and/or payments besides Stripe; not even us.</p>

<h3>Email</h3>
    <p>We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. We will send you email relating to your personal transactions, but we will keep these 
    emails to a minimum. You will also receive certain email notifications (forwarded messages, etc.), for which you may opt-out. We may send you service-related 
    announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.</p>
    <p>Campaign Owners (Content Creators) receive the email addresses of their backers, but will only use this information to communicate about their Social Teeth 
    campaign. Without your permission, they will not add your name to mailing lists, solicit you for other contributions, or use your information for any  
    purpose outside of communicating about their Social Teeth campaign.
    <h3>Technology / Security</h3>
    <p>Social Teeth uses cookies to help (anonymously) recognize you as a repeat visitor and to track traffic patterns on our site. We use this information to make 
    Social Teeth more user-friendly.</p>
    <p>Social Teeth may obtain IP addresses from users. We will use this information to monitor and prevent fraud, diagnose problems, and (anonymously) 
    estimate demographic information.</p>
    <p>We use a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication tools, to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information. 
    Your personal information is stored behind firewalls and is only accessible by a limited number of people who are required to keep the information 
    confidential.</p>
    <p>When you place orders we use a secure server. To the extent you select the secure server method and your browser supports such functionality, 
    all credit card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.</p>
    <p>Regardless of these efforts by us, no data transmission over the public Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
    <p>There may be links to other websites on Social Teeth. If you follow any links which remove you from socialteeth.org, policies other than this one will govern your activities.</p>
    <h3>Voluntary Disclosure</h3>
    <p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other users. 
    You should exercise caution before disclosing your personal information via these public venues.</p>
    <h3>Campaign Owners</h3>
    <p>By entering into our User Agreement, Social Teeth Campaign Owners agree to not abuse other users' personal information. Abuse is defined as using personal 
    information for any purpose other than those explicitly specified in the Campaign Ownerâ€™s ad campaign.</p>
    <p>Campaign Owners never receive users' credit card information.</p>
    <h3>Wrap-up</h3>
    <p>Social Teeth reserves the right to update this privacy policy at anytime. Updates to our privacy policy will be sent to the email address that you have provided us or posted prominently on the website.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law).</p>
    <p>To modify or delete any or all of the personal information you have provided to us, please log in and update your profile.</p>
    <p><em>People under 18 are not permitted to use Social Teeth on their own, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for their use of the site.</em></p>
