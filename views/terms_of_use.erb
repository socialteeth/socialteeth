Changes to fees are effective after we provide you with notice by posting the changes on the Site.

</p>
<p>
Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. Backers are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with your use of the site.

</p>
</li>

<li>REFUNDS 
</br>
<p>
Before the expiration date on the campaign, backers may request a refund at any time during the fundraising Campaign, before the expiration date provided on the campaign, except that they may not cancel their pledge if the campaign is within its final 24 hours and the cancellation would drop the campaign below its goal. If a Backer chooses to request a refund, they will be refunded the amount of their contribution minus a 2.9% fee charged by Stripe.
</p>
<p>
After the expiration date provided on the campaign, Social Teeth will not issue refunds  for contributions that have been collected for Campaigns that have successfully reached their fundraising goals.
</p>
<p>
Because of occasional failures of payments from Backers, Social Teeth cannot guarantee the full receipt of the amount pledged minus fees.
</p>
<p>
Social Teeth reserves the right to cancel or refund a contribution at any time for any reason. Social Teeth will notify Backers by email when a Campaign has been fully funded. If a Campaign is not funded by the expiration date provided on the campaign, Backers will be refunded the amount of their contribution minus the 2.9% fee that Stripe takes with every transaction that goes through Social Teeth.
</p>
</li>

<li>
TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION OF CAMPAIGNS

<p>
Social Teeth reserves the right to reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend a campaign at any time due to intellectual property infringement, problems with providers of advertising space, or other reasons at the sole discretion of Social Teeth.
