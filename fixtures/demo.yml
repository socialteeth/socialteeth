    description: >
      Situated at a strategic location between Egypt, Syria and Arabia, and the birthplace of Judaism and
      Christianity, the region has a long and tumultuous history as a crossroads for religion, culture,
      commerce, and politics. The region has been controlled by numerous different peoples, including Ancient
      Egyptians, Canaanites, Ancient Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Ancient Greeks, Romans,
      Byzantines, the Sunni Arab Caliphate, the Shia Fatimid Caliphate, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mameluks,
      Ottomans, the British and modern Israelis and Palestinians. Modern archaeologists and historians of the
      region refer to their field of study as Syro-Palestinian archaeology.

  - title: "Buy War Bonds"
    description: >
      War bonds are debt securities issued by a government for the purpose of financing military operations
      during times of war. War bonds generate capital for the government and make civilians feel involved in
      their national militaries. This system is also useful as a means of controlling inflation in such an
      overstimulated economy by removing money from circulation until hopefully after the war is concluded.

  - title: "Kennedy for President"
    description: >
      On January 2, 1960, Kennedy initiated his campaign for President in the Democratic primary election,
      where he faced challenges from Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota and Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon.
      Kennedy defeated Humphrey in Wisconsin and West Virginia, Morse in Maryland and Oregon, as well as from
      token opposition (often write-in candidates) in New Hampshire, Indiana, and Nebraska. Kennedy visited a
      coal mine in West Virginia; most miners and others in that predominantly conservative, Protestant state
      were quite wary of Kennedy's Roman Catholicism.

  - title: "Rosie the Riveter"
    description: >
      Rosie the Riveter is a cultural icon of the United States, representing the American women who worked
      in factories during World War II, many of whom produced munitions and war supplies. These women
      sometimes took entirely new jobs replacing the male workers who were in the military. Rosie the Riveter
      is commonly used as a symbol of feminism and women's economic power.

      If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is because everything
      would be what it isn't. And contrary-wise; what it is it wouldn't be, and what it wouldn't be, it would.
      You see?

      The time has come, my little friends, to talk of other things. Of shoes and ships and sealing wax, of
      cabbages and kings. And why the sea is boiling hot, and whether pigs have wigs. Calloo, Callay, come run
      away with the cabbages and kings.

      Better read it first, for if one drinks much from a bottle marked "Poison", it's almost certain to
      disagree with one sooner or later.
